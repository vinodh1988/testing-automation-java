Any Language can claim itself to be an Object oriented programming language
if and only if it supports

  * Encapsulation  - Properties + Functions(methods)  - class
  * Data abstraction/hiding
         -- allowing only the essentials to be accessed 
         hiding the implementation complexities
         
         Access specifiers
                   -- private
                   -- public
                   -- protected
                   -- default
  * Polymorphism
         One name taking many forms
         
          1. Constructor overloading
          2. Method overloading
          3. Method overriding
          4. Operator overloading(developer cannot do)
               ex: + act as arithmetic if used with numbers
                     act as concatination operator if used with strings 
  * Inheritance

  -------------------------------------------------
  
  * How to create class
  * How to create object
  * what is Constructor
  * What is default constructor
  * How to overload constructors
  * What are the types of variables
            * Instance variables
            * Local variables 
            * Static variables
            
   * Instance Members/variables
            variables that are associated with instance, a separate
            copy created for each instance, generally stored
            in heap space
    * Local Variables
            variables that are under the scope of a methods, will be
            alive as long the method is alive, temporarily stored in stack space
            
    * Static Variables
             Varibales that are shared by all the objects
             stored in stack space 
            could be accessed with class name itself and also by using objects
           
 Comments
 ---------------
 
     Multiline comment
        /*    */
        
     Single line comment
     
     // comment
     
     Documentation comment
     
   Comments are meant understanding of users and developers
   
   runtime, compiler has got nothing to do with comments they simply ignore it

   Object oriented programming
   
   Core Programming constructs
   
         1. Variables
         2. Data types
         3. Operators
         4. Control statements
         5. Arrays
         
 
   
   
   Annotations
   --------------
   
   Annotation is a meta code (code about code)
   
   annotations are also generally not meant for execution
   but
   
   1. users and developers
   2. compiler
   3. runtime
   
   all of these understands something because of annotations
