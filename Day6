                        what is inheritance
                        how inheritance works	
                        how parent class constructor is called

  keywords
  ---------
      class, public, private, protected, default (switch), static,
      int, float, double, char, byte, short, long,boolean
      void ,import,package,new,super, this, extends
      
  final keyword
  --------------
        Class: it cannot be inherited
        Method: it cannot be overridden
        Variable: it cannot be changed (constant)
        
        
 
access specifiers
        
		public  - (class,variable (not a local variable), method)
		private  (variable,method) --(you can use private before a class if it is inner class)
		protected - variable, method ) -- you can use protected before a inner class only 
		
		
	
	
	class A {
	
	    private class B {
		
		}
	
	}
	
	
static
-------

   can be used before a variable (not a local variable)
   can be used before a method
   
   can we use it before a class ? (no but not really)
         if a class is inner class it could be static 

class A {
     private static class B {
	 
	 }
}		 
   
final
------
     variable (local variable also ok)
	 method
	 class
	 
abstract
--------
        class - it cannot be instantiated
        method - it has to be implemented in child class (no definition in parent class)
        
 Note: A class can be abstract even if all the methods are concrete
    But a class cannot be concrete if it has an abstract method
