Instance
Object

     when we class , you can have as many objects as you want
     for the class
     
     Object - it is an instance of a class
     
     Ex:
       
       Employee -- e101,e102,e103
       Table -- table1, table2, table3
       
       To create an object , we use constructor
       
       constructor?
       
       constructor is a special method that has 
       same name as that of the class name
       
       it is used to instantiate object
       
       when object is instantiated
       
       all instance members copy will be associated with object
       
       person--> person1(sno,name,city)
                 person2(sno,name,city)
                 
         Eventhough you dont create constructor a default version
         is always created
         
         if you want you can overload additional constructors
         
       Constructor has no return type
       
       
     Common practice of oop
     ----------------------
     
     
     You should not able to manage 
     the instance variable of an instance
     using object refence 
     
     only you should able to use
     functionalities that are
     allowed to be used
     
     
  Abstraction
  ------------   
     Allowing only the essential details
     hiding the background implementation 
     
     
   polymorphism
   ------------
   
   one name many forms
   
   the form to be called will be determined automatically (compilation/execution)
