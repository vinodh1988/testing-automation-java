Inheritance is one of the core concepts of OOP
//    Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties of another class

 -- If we create a child object, it will have all the properties of parent object

 -- but if we create a parent object, it will not have the properties of child object
 
 if we create a child object using constructor of the child,
 it will call the constructor of the parent class (default constructor)
 
 if you want to call the constructor of parent class explicitly
 you can use super() keyword
